GMediaRender for Debian
-----------------------

This UPnP Media Render is designed to be run by any non-root user.
Alternatively, GMediaRender can be started at boot time by editing
/etc/default/gmediarender, setting GMEDIARENDERRUN to yes and setting
GMEDIARENDERNAME to the friendly name by which the server announces
itself. In this case GMediaRender is started as user gmediarender.
